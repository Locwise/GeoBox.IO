What is Webhooks?
------------------

 A Webhook is an HTTP callback, a HTTP POST which occurs when something happens; a simple event-notification via HTTP POST.
 
An application in which implemen Webbooks will POST a message to a URL when certain things occur. 
When a web application enables users to register their own URLs, the users can then extend, customize,
and integrate that application with their own custom extensions or even with other applications around the web.
WebHooks are a way to receive valuable information when it happens, rather than rapidly polling data and most of the time receive nothing valuable.
