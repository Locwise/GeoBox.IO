What is Webhooks?
------------------

A Webhook is an HTTP callback, a HTTP POST which occurs when event takes place - an event notification via HTTP POST.
 
An application in which implement Webbooks will POST a message to a URL when certain things occur. 

WebHooks are a way to receive valuable information when it happens, rather than rapidly polling data and most of the time receive nothing valuable.
