#What Are Webhooks?
------------------

A Webhook is an HTTP callback, a HTTP POST which occurs when event takes place - an event notification via HTTP POST.
An application in which implement Webbooks will be posted with a message when certain things occur.
WebHooks are the only way to get server notifications and receive only valuable information when it happens, rather than rapidly polling data and most of the time receive nothing valuable.
